This is a "nimenhuuto.com" type of django web app where people can create "groups" and events for the groups. 
Events have a limit which can be set for people to join. 
Different groups have invitation code to invite new people.

Usecase 1.
In a company people tend to decide where they will go to eat. Add a place and then people can decide on which place they want to go to eat. You can limit the partisipants based on how much space you have in your car.

This used to run in Heroku, so the database password is from that period.
